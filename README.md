# Full-Vehicle-Model
A 11 DOF Full Car Model covering all the vertical dynamics. The model consists of 4 unsprung mass displacement, 4 sprung mass displacements, CG displacement, roll and yaw.

# Running the Model

In order to run the model, the vehicle parameters will be required. These include:
1. Position of CG from the front axle (a_CG)
2. Position of CG from the rear axle (b_CG)
3. Front track width (tf)
4. Rear track width (tr)
5. Sprung Mass (Ms)
6. Unsprung Mass (mus1)
7. Moment of Inertia - Pitch (Ip)
8. Moment of Roll - Pitch (Ir)
9. Tire Stiffness (Ks_FL,Ks_RL,Ks_RR,Ks_FR)
10. Tire Damping Coefficient (Cs_FL,Cs_FR,Cs_RL,Cs_RR)
11. Suspension Stiffness and Damping Coefficient (Kx_sus, Cx_sus)
12. Tire Forces acing on each tire (tt1,tt2,tt3,tt4)
